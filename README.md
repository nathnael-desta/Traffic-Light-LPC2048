# Traffic Lights Simulation

This project simulates a traffic light system using Proteus and a microcontroller programmed with a HEX file. The simulation demonstrates how traffic lights manage the flow of vehicles at an intersection.

## Description

The project consists of:

- **Proteus Design File**: The circuit design and components configured in Proteus.
- **HEX File**: The compiled program that runs on the microcontroller to control the traffic lights' behavior.

The simulation includes:

- A standard traffic light sequence (e.g., red, yellow, green).
- Timing for smooth traffic flow.

The project is designed to help students and professionals understand traffic light logic and how to implement microcontroller-based systems.

## Steps to Run

1. **Install Required Software**:

   - [Proteus Design Suite](https://www.labcenter.com/)

2. **Open the Project**:

   - Launch Proteus.
   - Open the provided project file (`traffic final.pdsprj`).

3. **Load the HEX File**:

   - Double-click on the microcontroller in the Proteus schematic.
   - In the microcontroller's properties, locate the "Program File" section.
   - Browse and select the provided HEX file (`traffic lights.hex`).

4. **Run the Simulation**:
   - Click the "Run" button in Proteus to start the simulation.
   - Observe the traffic light sequence and behavior.

## Files Included

- `traffic final.pdsprj`: Proteus project file.
- `traffic lights.hex`: Compiled HEX file for the microcontroller.
